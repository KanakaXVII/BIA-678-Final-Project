I ordered a new purse but was sent a used one? Scratches on the metal detail and some sort of impression left in the leather. Not very happy considered I paid the new price for a reason... I didn’t want a used purse.,0
"The bag is cute but smaller than I thought it would be. I knew it would be small I just expected it to be a little bigger. The quality of the bag is very good and it looks expensive. It is the perfect everyday bag. I had read a review that the bag came in a dust bag but mine did not come in a dust bag so I am little disappointed.

Update: the zipper in the back pocket is no longer working and I have the bag for less than one month. Disappointed!",0
Beautiful purse! Black on black! It’s small but just the size I was looking for and holds a lot for its size. It looks like an expensive handbag!,1
 This purse is the perfect size for me and very stylish it goes with most of my outfits😁,1
It’s so cute and convenient. Have a lot pockets ✅,1
 I purchased this bag back in May2021. I finally pulled it out of its wrapper about 4 months ago and for the most part I was very happy until today when the bag handle came apart. I love Aldo however this is the first bag that I have purchased that has ever done that. As you can see it is still in perfect condition except for the handle. I’m not sure if I would recommend this bag in particular but I will still recommend another Aldo bag.,0
I’ve gotten so many compliments on his purse! Even from my really bougie friends,1
"I needed a purse and went on Amazon to look for one. I looked at several and then I found the Aldo purse, it caught my eye right away, its smart looking and looks like it's much more expensive than it is. So pretty and it has plenty of compartments. Buy one, you'll love the Aldo purse!!",1
I absolutely love!!,1
"I love this purse especially the black hardware BUT it’s already falling apart after less than 3 weeks of non-consecutive use. I have many cheaper priced purses I’ve owned for years that still hold up great, so it’s really disappointing to have paid a designer price for a brand I really trusted - especially since I totally saw myself using this purse for years bc it’s all black & can go with anything! I honestly don’t expect it to hold up much longer if it’s already in this condition so early in my ownership of this purse. Might have to swing by TJMaxx again for a purse that actually maintains its integrity overtime.",0
